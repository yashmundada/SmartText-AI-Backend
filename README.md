This project is a Spring Boot–based backend application that demonstrates how AI capabilities can be integrated into a backend system using RESTful APIs. The application exposes endpoints for text summarization, grammar correction, and question–answering, following clean code principles and Spring Boot best practices.

The solution is designed with a layered architecture, using proper DTOs, input validation, and centralized exception handling to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear API design. External AI services (such as OpenAI) are integrated to process user input and return intelligent responses, simulating real-world backend AI integration scenarios.

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment to showcase backend design skills, API development, AI integration, and the ability to explain and adapt the solution during a live walkthrough.
